# Computer Vision Portfolio

This project is a collection of computer vision work that shows my skills in image processing, feature extraction, and building simple vision models.  
It includes practical examples using Python, OpenCV, and machine learning libraries.  
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my learning, creativity, and my ability to turn concepts into working code.

## 📘 Semester Summary

This semester was a full journey into the world of computer vision.  
I started with the basics — understanding how images are built, how pixels work, and how simple filters can change the way an image looks. Step by step, I explored more advanced ideas like edge detection, feature extraction, and small machine learning models.

Throughout the semester, I worked through different tasks and hands-on projects.  
Each one helped me connect theory with real code. I learned how to use Python and OpenCV to clean, transform, and analyze images. Later on, I tried model training, classification, and understanding how computers “see” patterns.

By the end of the semester, I felt more confident in breaking down visual problems, writing cleaner code, and thinking like a computer vision developer. This portfolio shows the progress I made from day one to the final project.

## 📝 Midterm Summary

The midterm focused on core computer vision techniques.  
During this period, I learned how to apply image filters, adjust brightness and contrast, detect edges, and use operations like blurring, thresholding, and color conversion.

The main goal of the midterm was to show that I understand:

- How images are represented in arrays  
- How to manipulate pixels  
- How different filters affect image quality  
- How to extract meaningful information from raw images  

This section of the course built the foundation I needed for the second half of the semester.

## 🎯 Final Project Summary

The final project pushed my skills to a higher level.  
Here, I applied everything I learned to build a more complete and meaningful computer vision system. I worked with model training, image classification, and more advanced analysis techniques.

The final project helped me practice:

- Building a full pipeline (loading → processing → predicting)  
- Training a classifier on visual data  
- Organizing code in a clean and reusable structure  
- Evaluating performance and improving results  

This project reflects my growth, creativity, and confidence in applying computer vision techniques to real-world problems.
