# Clean vs Messy Room Classifier – Final Project

This final project uses computer vision and machine learning to classify room images as **clean** or **messy**.  
The project includes a full workflow: dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and a simple user interface for testing new images.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to help a computer automatically decide whether a room is clean or messy by analyzing an image.  
I prepared my own dataset, trained a model, and built a small demo to make predictions in real time.

## ▶️ How to Run
Open each notebook in order inside the final project folder:
1. **Dataset Preparation**  
2. **Training**  
3. **Evaluation**  
4. **User Interface**

Each notebook is clean, organized, and ready to run.
